Stone Paper Scissors is a simple two-player hand game where each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: Stone (a fist), Paper (an open hand), or Scissors (a V shape with two fingers). 
<br>
The rules are: Stone crushes Scissors, Scissors cut Paper, and Paper covers Stone. 
<br>
If both players choose the same shape, the game is a draw. The objective is to outsmart your opponent by picking the winning shape. 
<br>
<br>
It's a quick and fun game often used to make decisions or pass the time!
